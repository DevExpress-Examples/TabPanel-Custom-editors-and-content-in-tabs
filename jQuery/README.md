# jQuery

TabPanel may contain multiple [items](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTabPanel/Configuration/items/) but each item can be rendered differently. This can be done using the [template](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTabPanel/Configuration/items/#template) option.

Take a look at the [script.js](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/TabPanel-Custom-editors-and-content-in-tabs/blob/20.1.3%2B/jQuery/script.js) file of this example to see the required code.
